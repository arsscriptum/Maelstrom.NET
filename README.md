## Maelstrom.NET

<font size="3">**Maelstrom** : a state of confusion, turbulent movements or turmoil.</font>
<font size="2">_- "the compiled library was a maelstrom of code_"</font>

An open source C# obfuscator based on the old [ConfuserEx](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/) and more recent [neo-ConfuserEx](https://github.com/XenocodeRCE/neo-ConfuserEx.git) . It uses its own fork of [dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib/) for assembly manipulation. Maelstrom.NET handles most of the dotnet app, supports all elligible .NET Frameworks and provide decent obfuscation on your file.
